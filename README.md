![buttons](https://github.com/IvoKara/Interactive-Counter/blob/master/Images/push-buttons.png)

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step:</strong> Assingns the step </li>
  <li><strong>Way:</strong> Whether the counting is upwards(1,2,3..) or downwards(3,2,1..)[By default is upwards]. Transition between states is accomplished with just one click on the "Way" button. It is also responsible for the way the step variable changes. Ex: If the way is upwards, by clicking the "Step" button, step is ingreased by one.</li>
  <li><strong>Count:</strong> It is said by it's name - used for counting work.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
The output from all these assingments is shown on one 7-semgent display.
